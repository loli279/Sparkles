## ðŸŒŸ Project Story & Reflection

**Why I Built Sparkles**

I created Sparkles as a summer passion project at age 15, driven by my interest in healthcare and making a positive impact on childrenâ€™s health. As someone aspiring to pursue premed studies, I wanted to do more than just study textbooksâ€”I wanted to use technology and creativity to help others build healthy habits. As AI will continue to take over the world in the future, I thought that it would be important to adress this.

**What Makes Sparkles Unique**

- **For Kids, By a Teen:** Sparkles is designed for kids, by someone who remembers what makes learning fun and motivating at that age.
- **Positive Reinforcement:** The app uses achievements, streaks, and friendly guidance (from Dr. Sparkle!) to encourage healthy dental habits in a playful, non-judgmental way.
- **Educational + Fun:** By blending quizzes, games, and AI-powered chat, Sparkles teaches dental health concepts in an interactive and memorable fashion.
- **Modern Tech:** I built Sparkles with React, TypeScript, and AI (Google Gemini), learning new technologies as I went.

**What I Learned**

- **Problem-Solving:** Tackling challenges in both code and design, I learned to think like a developer *and* an educator.
- **Self-Motivation:** Without formal classes or volunteering opportunities (since I was too young), I found ways to grow and give back on my own.
- **Interdisciplinary Value:** This project showed me how technology and medicine can work together, shaping my perspective for the future.

**Looking Ahead**

Sparkles is a big step in my journey toward a career in medicine and technology. Iâ€™m proud of what I built in one summerâ€”and excited to keep learning, exploring, and helping others.
